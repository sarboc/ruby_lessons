# In lesson 2, you learned all about data types.
# You also need to know how to interact with a user.
# 'puts' is a method that will print any string to the user, followed by a newline.
# 'gets.chomp' is a method that will accept a string from the user.

# Write a basic program that asks a user for his/her name and then greets them.


# Write a basic program that asks a user for two numbers and adds them.
# Hint: 'gets.chomp' always returns a string. Call .to_i on the user inputs to convert them to integers.
