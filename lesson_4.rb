# Now that you know how to interact with the user, let's learn how to interact with hashes and arrays.

# ARRAYS
# Arrays can be instantiated in a few different ways, but the most common is to create an empty array.
# For example: foo = []
# Items can be added to an array using .push, or removed from an array using .pop.
# However, a more common Ruby syntax for adding an item to an array is the shovel: <<
# For example: foo << 3
# You can, of course, always start with items in your array, which should be separated by a comma.
# For example: foo = [1, 2, 3]

# Write a basic program that asks three different questions and stores the answers in an array.


# HASHES
# Similar to Arrays, Hashes are often instantiated by creating an empty hash.
# For example: foo = {}
# To add an item to a Hash, you need to specify both the key and value for the item.
# For example: foo[:bar] = 'bash'
# To start with items in a Hash, you need to specify key value pairs separated by commas.
# For example: foo = {bar: 1, bash: 2, buzz: 3}
# In older Ruby programs, you might see the hashrocket syntax. But the above is a more modern syntax.
# Avoid instantiating your Hashes like this: foo = {:bar => 1, :bash => 2, :buzz => 3}

# Write a basic program that asks three different questions and stores the answers in a hash.
